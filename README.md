FlipMart Sales Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project
This project presents an interactive and insight-rich Power BI dashboard built using FlipMart’s retail sales dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in sales, profit, product performance, and regional trends to support smart decision-making in the e-commerce space.

Project Overview:
